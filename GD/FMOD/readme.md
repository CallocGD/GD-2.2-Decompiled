## FMOD Headers
Header Files for FMod Inspired By Cocos-Headers

This is where FMOD Releated Stuff to Geomtery Dash will be reverse eningeered.

Please Note that it requires GD-2.2-Decompiled to prevent Intellisense from screaming at you about include errors. 


## FYI
This is not meant to be compiled but rather to be viewed as code to educate people about how gd works. 


Class Objects include all the Following 


- `FMODAudioEngine`
- `FMODAudioState`
- `FMODLevelVisualizer`
- `FMODQueuedEffect`
- `FMODQueuedMusic`
- `FMODReverbPresent`
- `FMODMusic`

These Files will be Seperate C++ files and headers until all class objects have been decompiled. Note that these will not require data directly from fmod excluding the use of Fmod's functions
and objects...
