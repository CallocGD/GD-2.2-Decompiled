## Robtop's FMOD Library
Header Files and reversed C++ code for FMod related stuff Inspired By Cocos-Headers

This is where FMOD Releated Stuff to Geomtery Dash will be reverse eningeered.

Please Note that it requires GD-2.2-Decompiled to prevent Intellisense from screaming at you about include errors. 


## FYI
This is not meant to be compiled but rather to be viewed as code to educate people about how gd works. 


Class Objects include all the Following 


- `FMODAudioEngine`
- `FMODAudioState`
- `FMODLevelVisualizer`
- `FMODQueuedEffect`
- `FMODQueuedMusic`
- `FMODReverbPresent`
- `FMODMusic`

These will only require One Header File and C++ File to be worked on, note that these will not require all the data directly from fmod excluding the use of Fmod's functions and objects...
