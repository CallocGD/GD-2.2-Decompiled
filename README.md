# GD-Decompiled
 An attempt to get the source code for Geometry Dash through reverse engineering and decompiling the game.  
I Calloc Have forked this repository for decompling other sources within 2.2 and beyond while wylie is off doing other things (Until he makes a 2.2 repository)
For now I shall dump what I do have for 2.204 and android v2.205 in here. Feel free to submit pull requests here so I can look at them I would like this to be an official repo for the people of geode to start using temporarly...

## Update 
- 2.206 is coming soon so we will make another repository possibly for that version and I might end up redoing everything due to how messy this repo feels to me...
- Even Better, Wylie told me he will be working on this stuff in the future so I will be archiving this repo up when that happens and then start moving everything that I have done to it. 

## Tools Used
See this [repo](https://github.com/CallocGD/Geometry-Dash-Miscellaneous-Decomp-Tools)


## My Goals with this fork
- To Finish what wyliemaster has started. Anything that hasn't been discovered or updated will be decompiled.
- Actually fully decompile whatever the current version of Geometry Dash is.
- I am Using Andorid Version 2.205 with ghidra and some help from [geode's bindings](https://github.com/geode-sdk/bindings) to help assist me with reverse engineering GD. 


## How Can I Contribute?
- Find Class members and adding them to the [geode bindings](https://github.com/geode-sdk/bindings).
- Downloading [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) or [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/IDA-pro/) and Reverse engineering some of these class objects and members.
- finding undocumented objects / class-members / C++ code and fully or even partially reverse engineered functions.
- Joining [the offical GD reverse engineering discord server](https://discord.gg/GpBrjrebd5), We are constantly needing and looking for help with unsolved functions or missing class members.
- finding Robtop code-snippets (aka. freebies), screenshotting and posting it into our discord server if you do not think we have that information yet 


## IMPORTANT

- This Project is intended to be used as reference material to assist with modding and to help understand current bugs or unsolved vulnerabilities 
- This repository is <b>not</b> a matching decompilation however we strive to be as correct as possible about it.
- This Code will be intended for compiling however __to prevent piracy, game assests, photos and other files will not be provided.__


## Buy GD

if for some reason you haven't already I recommend you go and buy GD

## Want to know more about the game?

if you want to know about the game and how various aspects work, you can find documentation [here](https://github.com/Wyliemaster/gddocs)
NOTE: Documentation is mainly from 2.11 at the moment and may need to be updated since new stuff has been added like levellists and more...
